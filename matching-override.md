# Matching Override

While Frontier's automatic matching is highly effective, there may be instances where you need to tailor the suggestions to better fit your project requirements or design nuances. Frontier provides an easy-to-use override feature that allows you to manually adjust the component matches.

How to Override a Component Match:

1. Access Override Options:
   - Navigate to the component list in the right panel.
2. Select a Component to Override:
   - Click on a specific component.
   - Use the “Nested components” tag to quickly jump to the first nested component in your selection.

3. Initiate the Override:
   - Click the ‘<ComponentName> Auto match’ tag to open the override dropdown menu, which displays a list of automatically matched candidates along with a search field for exploring alternatives.
4. Choose a Different Component:

- Review Candidates: Frontier will display the top three candidates that got the highest similarity score.
- Select a New Component: If the pre-selected match isn't perfect, choose a better-suited existing component suggestion, or use the search functionality to select another option from your codebase.

5. Confirming Changes:
   - Click the "Update Code" button to confirm your changes. Frontier will then update the code suggestions to reflect your manual overrides, which you can review to ensure they meet your expectations.

Benefits of Using the Override Feature:

- Customization: Tailor component matches to perfectly align with your specific project needs and design requirements.
- Control: Maintain full control over the automated process, ensuring the output is as you intend.
